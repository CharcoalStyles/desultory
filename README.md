## Info
This mod replaces the "normal" generators (code that makes each level) with one that randomises all the spawned items.

Generators for special episodes are not touched.

Also, a special variant was created for the Witch; while the 6th character (which I haven't unlocked yet) also hasnt been changed.

## Bugs
Occasionally the game seems to hang when loading a level. I have no idea why and no way to figure it out. I guess a black hole just runied your run. Sorry.

If you find any other bugs, please pop an issue on the Github page.
